cURLmeleon is your one-stop shop for conquering REST APIs. Thanks to the small size and low cpu usage, you can easily make requests to any API without the need for a browser or a large application.

# What does it do?

Thanks to a Rust backend, cURLmeleon is lightweight and fast. It doesn't try to do everything perfectly, but it aims at low cpu usage and fast execution. It's perfect for making quick requests to REST APIs.

You can make simple requests to test your endpoints, or you can enable the diagnostic toolbox to keep track with graphs and logs of the response codes and times.

You can even use the internal healthchecker to keep track of your endpoints and get notified when they go down. (all in the background of your computer while you go on with your day).

# Why?

cURLmeleon aims to be a fast, lightweight, simplified open-source alternative to Postman. Thanks to a simple feature set and a simplier interface.

# How to use it?

1. Download the latest release from the release page.
2. Install the application. (on MacOS, you can simply drag the app to your Applications folder)
3. Open the application.
4. Enjoy!
